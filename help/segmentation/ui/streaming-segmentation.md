description: Streaming segmentation on Adobe Experience Platform allows you to do segmentation in near real-time while focusing on data richness. With streaming segmentation, segment qualification now happens as data lands into Platform, alleviating the need to schedule and run segmentation jobs. With this capability, most segment rules can now be evaluated as the data is passed into Platform, meaning segment membership will be kept up-to-date without running scheduled segmentation jobs.

# Streaming segmentation

>[!NOTE]
>
>The following document states how to use streaming segmentation using the UI. For information on using streaming segmentation using the API, please read the [streaming segmentation API guide](../api/streaming-segmentation.md).

Streaming segmentation on [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] allows customers to do segmentation in near real-time while focusing on data richness. With streaming segmentation, segment qualification now happens as streaming data lands into [!DNL Platform], alleviating the need to schedule and run segmentation jobs. With this capability, most segment rules can now be evaluated as the data is passed into [!DNL Platform], meaning segment membership will be kept up-to-date without running scheduled segmentation jobs.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Streaming segmentation can only be used to evaluate data that is streamed into Platform. In other words, data ingested through batch ingestion will not be evaluated through streaming segmentation, and will require batch evaluation to be triggered.

## Streaming segmentation query types

>[!NOTE]
>
>In order for streaming segmentation to work, you will need to enable scheduled segmentation for the organization. For details on enabling scheduled segmentation, please refer to [the streaming segmentation section in the Segmentation user guide](./overview.md#scheduled-segmentation).

A query will be automatically evaluated with streaming segmentation if it meets any of the following criteria:

| Query type | Details | Example |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| Incoming hit | Any segment definition that refers to a single incoming event with no time restriction. | ![](../images/ui/streaming-segmentation/incoming-hit.png) |
| Incoming hit within a relative time window | Any segment definition that refers to a single incoming event **within the last seven days**. | ![](../images/ui/streaming-segmentation/relative-hit-success.png) |
| Profile only | Any segment definition that refers to only a profile attribute. | |
| Incoming hit that refers to a profile | Any segment definition that refers to a single incoming event, with no time restriction, and one or more profile attributes. | ![](../images/ui/streaming-segmentation/profile-hit.png) |
| Incoming hit that refers to a profile within a relative time window | Any segment definition that refers to a single incoming event and one or more profile attributes, **within the last seven days**. | ![](../images/ui/streaming-segmentation/profile-relative-success.png) |
| Multiple events that refer to a profile | Any segment definition that refers to multiple events **within the last 24 hours** and (optionally) has one or more profile attributes. | ![](../images/ui/streaming-segmentation/event-history-success.png) |

The following section lists segment definition examples that will **not** be enabled for streaming segmentation.

| Query type | Details | Example |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| Incoming hit within a relative time window | If the segment definition refers to an incoming event **not** within the **last seven-day period**. For example, within the **last two weeks**. | ![](../images/ui/streaming-segmentation/relative-hit-failure.png) |
| Incoming hit that refers to a profile within a relative window | The following options will **not** support streaming segmentation:<ul><li>An incoming event **not** within the **last seven-day period**.</li><li>A segment definition that includes [!DNL Adobe Audience Manager (AAM)] segments or traits.</li></ul> | ![](../images/ui/streaming-segmentation/profile-relative-failure.png) |
| Multiple events that refer to a profile | The following options will **not** support streaming segmentation:<ul><li>An event that does **not** occur within **the last 24 hours**.</li><li>A segment definition that includes Adobe Audience Manager (AAM) segments or traits.</li></ul> | ![](../images/ui/streaming-segmentation/event-history-failure.png) |
| Multi-entity queries | Multi-entity queries are, as a whole, **not** supported by streaming segmentation. | |

Additionally, some guidelines apply when doing streaming segmentation:

| Query type | Guideline |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Single event query | The look-back window is limited to **seven days**. |
| Query with event history | <ul><li>The look-back window is limited to **one day**.</li><li>A strict time ordering condition **must** exist between the events.</li><li>Only simple time orderings (before and after) between the events are allowed.</li><li>The individual events **cannot** be negated. However, the entire query **can** be negated.</li></ul>|

## Streaming segmentation segment details

After creating a streaming-enabled segment, you can view details of that segment. 

![](../images/ui/streaming-segmentation/monitoring-streaming-segment.png)

Specifically, details about the **[!UICONTROL total qualified audience size]** are shown. The **[!UICONTROL Total qualified audience size]** shows the total number of qualified audiences from the last completed segment job run. If a segment job wasn't completed within the last 24 hours, the number of audiences will be taken from an estimate instead.

Underneath is a line graph that shows the number of segments that were qualified and disqualified in the last 24 hours. The dropdown can be adjusted to show the last 24 hours, last week, or last 30 days.

Additional information about the last segment evaluation can be found by selecting the information bubble.
