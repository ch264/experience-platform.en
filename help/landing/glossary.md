**Contract Data "C" Labels:** Contract `C` labels are used to categorize data that has contractual obligations or is related to a customer's data governance policies.

**C1 Contract Label:** `C1` contract data governance label specifies data can only be exported from Adobe Experience Cloud in an aggregated form without including individual or device identifiers. For example, data that originated from social networks.

**C2 Contract Label:** `C2` contract data governance label specifies data that cannot be exported to a third-party. Some data providers have terms in their contracts that prohibit the export of data from where it was originally collected.  For example, social networks contracts often restrict the transfer of data you receive from them. C2 is more restrictive than C1, which only requires aggregation and anonymous data.

**C3 Contract Label:** `C3` contract data governance label specifies data that cannot be combined or otherwise used with directly identifiable information. Some data providers have terms in their contracts that prohibit the combination or use of that data with directly identifiable information.  For example, contracts for data sourced from ad networks, ad servers, and third-party data providers often include specific contractual prohibitions on the use of directly identifiable data.

**C5 Contract Label:** `C5` contract data governance label specifies data cannot be used for interest-based, cross-site targeting of content or ads. Interest-based targeting, or personalization, occurs if the following three conditions are met:  The data collected on-site is used to make inferences about a user's interest, is used in another context, such as on another site or app and is used to select which content or ads are served based on those inferences.

**C6 Contract Label:** `C6` contract data governance label specifies data cannot be used for on-site ad targeting. Data cannot be used for on-site ad targeting, including the selection and delivery of advertisements on your organization’s websites or apps or to measure the delivery and effectiveness of such advertisements.

**C7 Contract Label:** `C7` contract data governance label specifies data cannot be used for on-site targeting of content.  Data cannot be used for on-site content targeting, including the selection and delivery of content on your organization’s websites or apps or to measure the delivery and effectiveness of such content.  This includes previously collected information about users’ interest to select content, processing data about what content was shown, how often or how long it was shown, when and where it was shown, and whether the uses took any actions related to the content, including for example clicking on content.

**C8 Contract Label:** `C8` contract data governance label specifies data cannot be used for measurement of your organization’s websites or apps. Data cannot be used to measure, understand, and report on users’ usage of your organization’s sites or apps. This does not include interest-based targeting, which is the collection of information about your use of this service to subsequently personalize content and/or advertising in other contexts.

**C9 Contract Label:** `C9` contract data governance label specifies data cannot be used in Data Science workflows. Some contracts include explicit prohibitions on data used for data science.  Sometimes these are phrased in terms that prohibit the use of data for artificial intelligence (AI), machine-learning (ML), or modeling.

**C10 Contract Label:** `C10` contract data governance label specifies data data cannot be used for stitched identity activation. Some data usage policies restrict the use of stitched identity data for personalization. The C10 label is automatically applied to segments if their merge policies use the "private graph" option.

**Created Date Column:** Selecting a `Created Date` column is an option when specifying third-party data via a connection. When the append save strategy is selected and the dataset contains a multiple dates related schema, the user must choose from the available date/time schema to specify a `Created Date` key column. `Created Date` option is not available when the overwrite save strategy is selected.

**Create Table as Select:** Create Table as Select is a SQL command which, when executed as a part of a complete and valid SQL query, will instruct the [!DNL Query Service] to persist the results of the query in a dataset on the Data Lake. Options include: Create New, Overwrite all Previous, and Append to Previous.

**Cross-site Data:** Cross-site data is the combination of data from several sites, including a combination of on-site data and off-site data or a combination of data from several off-site sources.

## X

**XDM (Experience Data Model):** XDM (Experience Data Model) is the concept of using standard schemas to unify data for use with [!DNL Experience Platform] and Adobe Experience Cloud applications. XDM is a formal specification used to represent all customer experience data in a single language or standard data model and standardizes how data is structured and speeds up and simplifies the process of gaining insights from massive amounts of data.

**XDM DecisionEvent:** A DecisionEvent is used to capture observations about the outcome and context of a decision activity, including information about how the decision was made, when it occurred, what options were proposed (and chosen) and what contextual state existed that either influenced the decision or could be observed during the decision process. DecisionEvents also capture the proposition ID, a globally unique identifier that can be used to correlate the decision to other events. DecisionEvents are not only relatable to Experience Events that impacted a decision but also to ExperienceEvents that are a direct response to a proposition. It is the expectation that applications reference the proposition ID in every ExperienceEvent that was influenced by the propositions. The proposition-response history in an individual profile is maintained using proposition IDs.

**XDM ExperienceEvent:** An ExperienceEvent is a fact record of what occurred, including the point in time and identity of the individual involved. ExperienceEvents can be either explicit (directly observable human actions) or implicit (raised without a direct human action) and are recorded without aggregation or interpretation. They are critical for time-domain analytics as they allow for observation and analysis of changes that occur in a given window of time and the comparison between multiple windows of time to track trends.

**XDM Individual Profile:** An XDM [!DNL Individual Profile] forms a singular representation of the attributes and interests of both identified and partially-identified individuals. Less-identified profiles may contain only anonymous behavioral signals, such as browser cookies, while highly-identified profiles may contain detailed personal information such as name, date of birth, location, and email address. As a profile grows, it becomes a robust repository of personal information, identification information, contact details, and communication preferences for an individual.

**XDM System:** XDM System is the infrastructure, data semantics, and workflow in [!DNL Experience Platform] that is powered by standard schemas.
