# [!DNL Privacy Service] and [!DNL Experience Cloud] applications

Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Privacy Service] is built to support privacy requests for several Adobe Experience Cloud applications. Each application supports different product values and IDs for identifying data subjects.

This document serves as a reference for [!DNL Experience Cloud] application documentation that outlines how to configure that application for privacy-related operations. This includes how to format and label your data. Two categories of applications are covered:

* [Applications integrated with Privacy Service](#integrated): Applications that are able to send access, delete, or opt-out requests to [!DNL Privacy Service].
* [Self-serve applications](#self-serve): Applications that must manage their privacy requests internally, and cannot communicate with [!DNL Privacy Service] directly.

Please review the documentation for your [!DNL Experience Cloud] applications to learn how to format your privacy requests, and which values are supported for those requests.
