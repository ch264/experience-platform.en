# [!DNL Data Science Workspace] troubleshooting guide

This document provides answers to frequently asked questions about Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Data Science Workspace]. For questions and troubleshooting regarding [!DNL Platform] APIs in general, see the [Adobe Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide](../landing/troubleshooting.md).

## [!DNL JupyterLab] environment is not loading in [!DNL Google Chrome]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This issue has been resolved but could still be present in the Google Chrome 80.x browser. Please ensure your Chrome browser is up-to-date. 

With the [!DNL Google Chrome] browser version 80.x, all third-party cookies are blocked by default. This policy can prevent [!DNL JupyterLab] from loading within Adobe Experience Platform.

To remedy this issue use the following steps: 

 In your [!DNL Chrome] browser, navigate to the top-right and select **Settings** (alternatively you can copy and paste "chrome://settings/" in the address bar). Next, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Advanced** dropdown.

The *Privacy and security* section appears. Next, click on **Site settings** followed by **Cookies and site data**.

Lastly, toggle “Block third-party cookies” to "OFF".

>[!NOTE]
>
>Alternatively, you could disable third-party cookies and add [*.]ds.adobe.net to the allow list.

Navigate to “chrome://flags/” in your address bar. Search for and disable the flag titled *“SameSite by default cookies”* by using the dropdown menu on the right.

After Step 2, you are prompted to relaunch your browser. After you relaunch, [!DNL Jupyterlab] should be accessible.

## Why am I unable to access [!DNL JupyterLab] in Safari?

Safari disables third-party cookies by default in Safari < 12. Because your [!DNL Jupyter] virtual machine instance resides on a different domain than its parent frame, Adobe Experience Platform currently requires that third-party cookies be enabled. Please enable third-party cookies or switch to a different browser such as [!DNL Google Chrome].

For Safari 12, you need to switch your User Agent to '[!DNL Chrome]' or '[!DNL Firefox]'. To switch your User Agent, start by opening the *Safari* menu and select **Preferences**. The preferences window appears.

![Safari preferences](./images/faq/preferences.png)

Within the Safari preferences window, select **Advanced**. Then check the *Show Develop menu in menu bar* box. You can close the preferences window after this step is complete.

Next, from the top navigation bar select the **Develop** menu. From within the *Develop* dropdown, hover over *User Agent*. You can select the **[!DNL Chrome]** or **[!DNL Firefox]** User Agent string you would like to use.

## Why am I seeing a '403 Forbidden' message when trying to upload or delete a file in [!DNL JupyterLab]?

If your browser is enabled with advertisement blocking software such as [!DNL Ghostery] or [!DNL AdBlock] Plus, the domain "\*.adobe.net" must be allowed in each advertisement blocking software for [!DNL JupyterLab] to operate normally. This is because [!DNL JupyterLab] virtual machines run on a different domain than the [!DNL Experience Platform] domain.

## Why do some parts of my [!DNL Jupyter Notebook] look scrambled or do not render as code?

This can happen if the cell in question is accidentally changed from "Code" to "Markdown". While a code cell is focused, pressing the key combination **ESC+M** changes the type of the cell to Markdown. A cell's type can be changed by the dropdown indicator at the top of the notebook for the selected cell(s). To change a cell type to code, start by selecting the given cell you want to change. Next, click the dropdown that indicates the cell's current type, then select "Code".

## How do I install custom [!DNL Python] libraries?

The [!DNL Python] kernel comes pre-installed with many popular machine learning libraries. However, you can install additional custom libraries by executing the following command within a code cell:

```shell
!pip install {LIBRARY_NAME}
```

For a complete list of pre-installed [!DNL Python] libraries, see the [appendix section of the JupyterLab User Guide](./jupyterlab/overview.md#supported-libraries).

## Can I install custom PySpark libraries?

Unfortunately, you cannot install additional libraries for the PySpark kernel. However, you can contact your Adobe customer service representative to have custom PySpark libraries installed for you.

For a list of pre-installed PySpark libraries, see the [appendix section of the JupyterLab User Guide](./jupyterlab/overview.md#supported-libraries). 

## Is it possible to configure [!DNL Spark] cluster resources for [!DNL JupyterLab] [!DNL Spark] or PySpark kernel?

You can configure resources by adding the following block to the first cell of your notebook:

```python
%%configure -f 
{
    "numExecutors": 10,
    "executorMemory": "8G",
    "executorCores":4,
    "driverMemory":"2G",
    "driverCores":2,
    "conf": {
        "spark.cores.max": "40"
    }
}
```

For more information on [!DNL Spark] cluster resource configuration, including the complete list of configurable properties, see the [JupyterLab User Guide](./jupyterlab/overview.md#kernels).
