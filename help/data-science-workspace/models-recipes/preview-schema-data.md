# Preview schemas and datasets

Upon successful completion of the bootstrap script from the [Create the retail sales schema and dataset](./create-retails-sales-dataset.md) tutorial. Output schemas and datasets can be viewed on [!DNL Experience Platform]. To view the schemas and datasets follow the steps below:

1.  Click the **[!UICONTROL Schemas]** link located in the left navigation column and find the input schema created by the bootstrap script. The name of the schema will correspond to what was defined in `config.yaml` from the previous step. View the schema details and it's composition by clicking into it.
