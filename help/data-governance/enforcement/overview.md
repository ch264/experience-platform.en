# Policy enforcement overview

Once data usage labels have been applied to [!DNL Platform] datasets, and data usage policies have been defined for marketing actions against those labels, [!DNL Data Governance] capabilities allow you to enforce those policies and prevent data operations that constitute policy violations.

There are two methods of policy enforcement provided by [!DNL Data Governance] features on [!DNL Platform]: **API-based enforcement** and **automatic enforcement**.

## API-based enforcement

The [!DNL Policy Service] API provides endpoints that allow you to test marketing actions against datasets or arbitrary combinations of data usage labels in order to check if any policy violations occur. Based on the API response, you can then set up protocols within your experience application to appropriately enforce data usage policy compliance.

See the tutorial on [policy enforcement](api-enforcement.md) for steps on how to evaluate policies using the API.

## Automatic enforcement

Certain applications that are built on top of [!DNL Experience Platform] (such as [!DNL Real-time Customer Data Platform]) provide automatic enforcement for data usage policies. Each application maintains its own method of surfacing policy violations and providing steps for resolving issues. 

Please consult the documentation for the [!DNL Platform]-based application you are using for more information on automatic data usage policy enforcement. For information on automatic policy enforcement in Real-time CDP, please refer to the [Real-time CDP Data Governance overview](../../rtcdp/privacy/data-governance-overview.md#enforce-data-usage-compliance).
