# Google Customer Match Destination

## Overview {#overview}

[Google Customer Match](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6379332?hl=en) lets you use your online and offline data to reach and re-engage with your customers across Google's owned and operated properties, such as: [!DNL Search], [!DNL Shopping], [!DNL Gmail], and [!DNL YouTube].

## Use Cases

To help you better understand how and when you should use the [!DNL Google Customer Match] destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform customers can solve by using this feature.


### Use Case #1

An athletic apparel brand wants to reach existing customers through [!DNL Google Search] and [!DNL Google Shopping] to personalize offers and items based on their past purchases and browsing history. The apparel brand can ingest email addresses from their own CRM to Adobe Real-time CDP, build segments from their own offline data, and send these segments to [!DNL Google Customer Match] to be used across [!DNL Search] and [!DNL Shopping], optimizing their advertising spending.  

### Use Case #2

A prominent technology company has just released a new phone. In an effort to promote this new phone model, they are looking to drive awareness of the new features and functionality of the phone to customers who own previous models of their phones. 

To promote the release, they upload email addresses from their CRM database into Adobe Real-time CDP, using the email addresses as identifiers. Segments are created based on customers who own older phone models and sent to [!DNL Google Customer Match] so that they can target current customers, customers who own older phone models, as well as similar customers on [!DNL YouTube]. 

## Data governance for [!DNL Google Customer Match] destinations {#data-governance}

The destinations in Adobe Real-time CDP may have certain rules and obligations for data sent to, or received from, the destination platform. You are responsible for understanding the limitations and obligations of your data and how you use that data in Adobe Experience Platform and the destination platform. Adobe Experience Platform provides data governance tools to help you manage some of those data usage obligations. [Learn more](/help/data-governance/labels/overview.md) about data governance tools and policies.

## Activation Type and Identities {#activation-type}

**Segment Export** - you are exporting all members of a segment (audience) with the identifiers (name, phone number, etc.) used in the [!DNL Google Customer Match] destination.

**Identities** - you can use raw or hashed emails as customer IDs in Google

## [!DNL Google Customer Match] account prerequisites {#google-account-prerequisites}

Before setting up a [!DNL Google Customer Match] destination in Adobe Real-time CDP, make sure you read and adhere to Google's policy for using [!DNL Customer Match], outlined in the [Google support documentation](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6299717). 

### Allow list {#allowlist}

>[!NOTE]
>
>It is mandatory to be added to Google's allow list before setting up your first [!DNL Google Customer Match] destination in Adobe Real-time CDP. Please ensure the allow list process described below has been completed by Google before creating a destination.

Before creating the [!DNL Google Customer Match] destination in Adobe Real-time CDP, you must contact Google and follow the allow list instructions in [Use Customer Match partners to upload your data](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7361372?hl=en&ref_topic=6296507) in the Google documentation.


### Email hashing requirements {#hashing-requirements}

<!--

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> When using mobile device IDs as identifiers, an AppId must be provided in the activation flow. For more information, see step 6 in the [Activate segments](#activate-segments) section of this page.

-->

Google requires that no personally identifiable information (PII) is sent in clear. Therefore, the audiences activated to [!DNL Google Customer Match] must be keyed off *hashed* email addresses. You can choose to hash email addresses before ingesting them into Adobe Experience Platform, or you can choose to work with email addresses in clear in Experience Platform and have our algorithm hash them on activation.

For more information about Google's hashing requirements and other restrictions on activation, see the following sections in Google's documentation:

* [[!DNL Customer Match] with email address, address, or user ID](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/remarketing#customer_match_with_email_address_address_or_user_id)
* [[!DNL Customer Match] considerations](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/remarketing#customer_match_considerations)

<!--

Links to be added when activation based on phone number and device IDs becomes available.

* [Customer Match with phone number](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/remarketing#customer_match_with_phone_number)
* [Customer Match with mobile device IDs](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/remarketing#customer_match_with_mobile_device_ids)

-->

To learn about ingesting email addresses in Experience Platform, see the [batch ingestion overview](/help/ingestion/batch-ingestion/overview.md) and the [steaming ingestion overview](/help/ingestion/streaming-ingestion/overview.md).

If you select to hash the email addresses yourself, make sure to comply with Google's requirements, outlined in the links above.


>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you choose not to hash email addresses, Adobe Real-time CDP will do that for you when you activate segments to [!DNL Google Customer Match]. In the [activation workflow](/help/rtcdp/destinations/google-customer-match-destination.md#activate-segments) (see step 5), select the `Email` option as shown below for *plain text email addresses* and `Email_LC_SHA256` for *hashed email addresses*.
