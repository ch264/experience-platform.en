## Activate segments {#activate-segments}

See [Activate profiles and segments to a destination](/help/rtcdp/destinations/activate-destinations.md) for information about the segment activation workflow.

## Destination attributes {#destination-attributes}

When [activating segments](/help/rtcdp/destinations/activate-destinations.md) to the [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] destination, we recommend that you select a unique identifier from your [union schema](../../profile/home.md#profile-fragments-and-union-schemas). Select the unique identifier and any other XDM fields that you want to export to the destination. For more information, see [Select which schema fields to use as destination attributes in your exported files](/help/rtcdp/destinations/email-marketing-destinations.md#destination-attributes) in Email Marketing Destinations.

## Exported data {#exported-data}

For [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] destinations, Adobe Real-time CDP creates a tab-delimited `.txt` or `.csv` file in the storage location that you provided. For more information about the files, see [Email Marketing destinations and Cloud storage destinations](/help/rtcdp/destinations/activate-destinations.md#esp-and-cloud-storage) in the segment activation tutorial. 

<!--

Expect a new file to be created in your storage location every day. The file format is:

`Oracle_Eloqua_segment<segmentID>_<timestamp-yyyymmddhhmmss>.csv`

```
Oracle_Eloqua_segment12341e18-abcd-49c2-836d-123c88e76c39_20200408061804.csv
Oracle_Eloqua_segment12341e18-abcd-49c2-836d-123c88e76c39_20200409052200.csv
Oracle_Eloqua_segment12341e18-abcd-49c2-836d-123c88e76c39_20200410061130.csv
```

The presence of these files in your storage location is confirmation of successful activation. To understand how the exported files are structured, you can [download a sample .csv file](/help/rtcdp/destinations/assets/sample_export_file_segment12341e18-abcd-49c2-836d-123c88e76c39_20200408061804.csv).
