# [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud]

## Overview

[[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud]](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/email-marketing/) is a digital marketing suite formerly known as ExactTarget that allows you to build and customize journeys for visitors and customers to personalize their experience.

To send segment data to [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud], you must first [connect the destination](#connect-destination) in Adobe Real-time CDP, and then [set up a data import](#import-data-into-salesforce) from your storage location into [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud].

## Connect destination {#connect-destination}

1. In **[!UICONTROL Connections]** > **[!UICONTROL Destinations]**, select [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud], then select **[!UICONTROL Connect destination]**.

2. In the **[!UICONTROL Authentication]** step, if you had previously set up a connection to your cloud storage destination, select **[!UICONTROL Existing Account]** and select one of your existing connections. Or, you can select **[!UICONTROL New Account]** to set up a new connection. Fill in your account authentication credentials and select **[!UICONTROL Connect to destination]**. For [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud], you can select between **[!UICONTROL SFTP with Password]** and **[!UICONTROL SFTP with SSH Key]**. Fill in the information below, depending on your connection type, and select **[!UICONTROL Connect to destination]**.

    For **[!UICONTROL SFTP with Password]** connections, you must provide Domain, Port, Username, and Password.
    For **[!UICONTROL SFTP with SSH Key]** connections, you must provide Domain, Port, Username, and SSH Key.

4. Click **[!UICONTROL Create destination]** after filling in the fields above. Your destination is now connected and you can [activate segments](/help/rtcdp/destinations/activate-destinations.md) to the destination.

## Activate segments {#activate-segments}

See [Activate profiles and segments to a destination](/help/rtcdp/destinations/activate-destinations.md) for information about the segment activation workflow.

## Destination attributes {#destination-attributes}

When [activating segments](/help/rtcdp/destinations/activate-destinations.md) to the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] destination, we recommend that you select a unique identifier from your [union schema](../../profile/home.md#profile-fragments-and-union-schemas). Select the unique identifier and any other XDM fields that you want to export to the destination. For more information, see [Select which schema fields to use as destination attributes in your exported files](/help/rtcdp/destinations/email-marketing-destinations.md#destination-attributes) in Email Marketing Destinations.

## Exported data {#exported-data}

For [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] destinations, Adobe Real-time CDP creates a tab-delimited `.txt` or `.csv` file in the storage location that you provided. For more information about the files, see [Email Marketing destinations and Cloud storage destinations](/help/rtcdp/destinations/activate-destinations.md#esp-and-cloud-storage) in the segment activation tutorial. 

<!--

Expect a new file to be created in your storage location every day. The file format is:

`Salesforce_Marketing_Cloud_segment<segmentID>_<timestamp-yyyymmddhhmmss>.csv`

```
Salesforce_Marketing_Cloud_segment12341e18-abcd-49c2-836d-123c88e76c39_20200408061804.csv
Salesforce_Marketing_Cloud_segment12341e18-abcd-49c2-836d-123c88e76c39_20200409052200.csv
Salesforce_Marketing_Cloud_segment12341e18-abcd-49c2-836d-123c88e76c39_20200410061130.csv
```

The presence of these files in your storage location is confirmation of successful activation. To understand how the exported files are structured, you can [download a sample .csv file](/help/rtcdp/destinations/assets/sample_export_file_segment12341e18-abcd-49c2-836d-123c88e76c39_20200408061804.csv). This sample file includes the profile attributes `person.firstname`, `person.lastname`, `person.gender`, `person.birthyear`, and `personalEmail.address`.
