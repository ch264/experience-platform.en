>The [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] destination in Adobe Real-time CDP is currently in beta. The documentation and the functionality are subject to change.

## Overview {#overview}

The [!DNL Kinesis Data Streams] service by [!DNL Amazon Web Services] allows you to collect and process large streams of data records in real time. 

You can create a real-time outbound connection to your [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] storage to stream data from Adobe Experience Platform. 

* For more information about [!DNL Amazon Kinesis], see the [Amazon documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html).
* To connect to [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] using API calls, see the [Streaming destinations API tutorial](/help/rtcdp/destinations/streaming-destinations-api-tutorial.md).

## Use Cases {#use-cases}

By using streaming destinations such as [!DNL Amazon Kinesis], you can easily feed high-value segmentation events and associated profile attributes into your systems of choice.

For example, a prospect downloaded a white-paper which qualifies them into a "high-propensity to convert" segment. By mapping the segment that the prospect falls in to the [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] destination, you would receive this event in [!DNL Amazon Kinesis]. There, you can employ a do-it-yourself approach and describe business logic on top of the event, as you think would work best with your enterprise IT systems.

## Connect destination {#connect-destination}

See [Cloud storage destinations workflow ](/help/rtcdp/destinations/cloud-storage-destinations-workflow.md)for instructions on how to connect to your cloud storage destinations, including those supported by [!DNL Amazon].
