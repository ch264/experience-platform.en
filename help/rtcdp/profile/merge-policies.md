# Merge policies in Real-time CDP

Built on top of Adobe Experience Platform, [!DNL Real-time Customer Data Platform] enables you to bring data together from multiple sources and combine it in order to see a complete view of each of your individual customers. When bringing this data together, merge policies are the rules that [!DNL Platform] uses to determine how data will be prioritized and what data will be combined to create that unified view.

Through the user interface, you can create new merge policies, manage existing policies, and set a default merge policy for your organization. You can also specify preferences regarding data sources and determine which data has priority should a conflict arise while merging.

You can find step-by-step instructions for working with merge policies using the Adobe Experience Platform user interface by following the [merge policies user guide](../../profile/ui/merge-policies.md).
