# Datasets

Within the Adobe Experience Platform user interface, you are able to view and manage all of the datasets that your IMS Organization has made, as well as create new ones. To browse Datasets in the UI, select **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** in the left-hand navigation. The **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab contains a list of datasets, including columns showing [!UICONTROL Name], [!UICONTROL Created (date and time)], [!UICONTROL Source], [!UICONTROL Schema], and [!UICONTROL Last Batch Status], as well as the date and time the dataset was Last Updated.

For information about Datasets in [!DNL Experience Platform], begin by reading the [Datasets overview](../../catalog/datasets/overview.md).
