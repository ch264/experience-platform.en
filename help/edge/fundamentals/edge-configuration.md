# Configuring the Edge

The configuration for the Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Web SDK] is split between two places. The [configure command](configuring-the-sdk.md) in the SDK controls things that must be handled on the client, like the `edgeDomain`. The edge configuration handles all other configuration for the SDK. When a request is sent to the Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Edge Network], the `edgeConfigId` is used to reference the server side configuration. This allows you to update the configuration without having to make code changes on your website. 

## Creating an Edge Configuration ID

Edge configuration IDs can be created in Adobe [!DNL Launch] using the edge configuration tool. This tool allows you to create both the edge configuration as well as environments within those configurations.

![edge configuration tool navigation](../../assets/edge_configuration_nav.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>The edge configuration tool is available to customers on the allow list regardless whether they use [!DNL Launch] as a tag manager. Additionally, users require Develop permissions in [!DNL Launch]. See the [User Permissions](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/launch/using/reference/admin/user-permissions.html) article in the [!DNL Launch] documentation for more details.

You can create an edge configuration by clicking on **[!UICONTROL New Edge Configuration]** in the top right area of the screen. After you provide a name and a description, you are asked for the default settings for each environment.

### Default Environment Settings

These default settings are used to create your first three environments with identical settings. These three environments are *dev*, *stage*, and *prod*. They match the three default environments in [!DNL Launch]. When you build a [!DNL Launch] library to a dev environment, the library automatically uses the dev environment from your configuration. You can edit settings in individual environments as much as you'd like.

The ID used in the SDK as the `edgeConfigId` is a composite ID that specifies the configuration and the environment. If no environment is present, then the production environment is used.

### Environment Settings

Below are each of the settings available to an environment. Most sections can be enabled or disabled. When disabled, your settings are saved but are not active.

#### [!UICONTROL Identity]

The identity section is the only section that is always on. It has two available settings: [!UICONTROL ID Syncs Enabled] and [!UICONTROL ID Sync Container ID].

![Identity section of the configuration UI](../../assets/edge_configuration_identity.png)

##### [!UICONTROL ID Sync Enabled]

Controls whether or not the SDK performs identity syncs with 3rd-party partners.

##### [!UICONTROL ID Sync Container ID]

ID syncs can be grouped into containers to allow different ID syncs to be run at different times. This controls which container of ID syncs is run for a given configuration ID.

#### Adobe Experience Platform

The settings listed here enable you to send data to the Adobe Experience Platform. You should only enable this section if you have purchased the Adobe Experience Platform.

##### [!UICONTROL Sandbox]

Sandboxes are locations in the Adobe Experience Platform that allow customers to isolate their data and implementations from each other. For more details about how they work, see the [Sandboxes documentation](../../sandboxes/home.md).

##### [!UICONTROL Streaming Inlet]

A streaming inlet is an HTTP source in the Adobe Experience Platform. These are created under the [!UICONTROL Sources] tab in the Adobe Experience Platform as an HTTP API.

##### [!UICONTROL Event Dataset]

Edge configurations support sending data to datasets that have a schema of class [!UICONTROL Experience Event].

#### Adobe Target

To configure Adobe Target, you must provide a client code. The other fields are optional.

![Adobe Target settings block](../../assets/edge_configuration_target.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Organization associated with the client code must match the organization where the configuration ID is created.

##### [!UICONTROL Client Code]

The unique ID for a target account. To find this, you can navigate to [!UICONTROL Adobe Target] > [!UICONTROL Setup]> [!UICONTROL Implementation] > [!UICONTROL edit settings] next to the [!UICONTROL download] button for either [!UICONTROL at.js] or [!UICONTROL mbox.js]

##### [!UICONTROL Property Token]

[!DNL Target] allows customers to control permissions through the use of properties. Details can be found in the [Enterprise Permissions](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/administer/manage-users/enterprise/properties-overview.html) section of the [!DNL Target] documentation.

The property token can be found in [!UICONTROL Adobe Target] > [!UICONTROL setup] > [!UICONTROL Properties]

##### [!UICONTROL Target Environment ID]

[Environments](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/administer/hosts.html) in Adobe Target help you manage your implementation through all stages of development. This setting specifies which environment you are going to use with each environment.

Adobe recommends setting this differently for each of your `dev`, `stage`, and `prod` edge configuration environments to keep things simple. However, if you already have [!UICONTROL Adobe Target environments] defined, you can use those.

#### Adobe Audience Manager

All that is needed to send data to Adobe Audience Manager is to enable this section. The other settings are optional but encouraged.

##### [!UICONTROL Cookie Destinations Enabled]

Allows the SDK to share segment information via [Cookie Destinations](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/audience-manager/user-guide/features/destinations/custom-destinations/create-cookie-destination.html) from [!DNL Audience Manager].

##### [!UICONTROL URL Destinations Enabled]

Allows the SDK to share segment information via [URL Destinations](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/audience-manager/user-guide/features/destinations/custom-destinations/create-url-destination.html). These are configured in [!DNL Audience Manager].

#### Adobe Analytics

Controls whether data is sent to Adobe Analytics. Additional details are in the [Analytics Overview](../solution-specific/analytics/analytics-overview.md).

![Adobe Analytics Settings Block](../../assets/edge_configuration_aa.png)

##### [!UICONTROL Report Suite ID]

The report suite can be found in the Adobe Analytics Admin section under [!UICONTROL Admin > ReportSuites]. If multiple report suites are specified, then data is copied to each report suite.
