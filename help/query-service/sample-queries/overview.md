# Sample queries

Adobe Experience Cloud solution data is available natively in [!DNL Experience Platform]. For the first time, you are able to query Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, Adobe Campaign, and Adobe Audience Manager Data from the same data store without having to move data around. As data is ingested from the solutions into Adobe Experience Platform it is transformed into [!DNL Experience Event Experience Data Model] (Experience Event XDM). This provides a layer of schema normalization. 

There are a number of standard queries that you might want to run against your Adobe data. Please see the documents below for sample queries for Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target. Sample queries for other solution data will be added in the future.
