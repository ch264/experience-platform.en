# SQL reference

[!DNL Query Service] provides the ability to use standard ANSI SQL for `SELECT` statements and other limited commands. [!DNL Query Service] does not include Data Definition Language or Data Manipulation Language functionality. The data queried via the service comes from [!DNL Experience Data Lake], which contains largely immutable datasets.
