# Create a [!DNL Google AdWords] source connector in the UI

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Google AdWords] connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

Source connectors in Adobe Experience Platform provide the ability to ingest externally sourced data on a scheduled basis. This tutorial provides steps for creating a [!DNL Google AdWords] source connector using the [!DNL Platform] user interface.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

*   [[!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) System](../../../../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which [!DNL Experience Platform] organizes customer experience data.
    *   [Basics of schema composition](../../../../../xdm/schema/composition.md): Learn about the basic building blocks of XDM schemas, including key principles and best practices in schema composition.
    *   [Schema Editor tutorial](../../../../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md): Learn how to create custom schemas using the Schema Editor UI.
*   [[!DNL Real-time Customer Profile]](../../../../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.

If you already have a valid [!DNL Google AdWords] connection, you may skip the remainder of this document and proceed to the tutorial on [configuring a dataflow](../../dataflow/payments.md)

### Gather required credentials

In order to access your [!DNL Google AdWords] account [!DNL Platform], you must provide the following values:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `clientCustomerId` | The Client customer ID of the [!DNL AdWords] account. |

## Connect your [!DNL Google AdWords] account

Once you have gathered your required credentials, you can follow the steps below to link your [!DNL Google AdWords] account to [!DNL Platform].

Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform](https://platform.adobe.com) and then select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** from the left navigation bar to access the **[!UICONTROL Sources]** workspace. The **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** screen displays a variety of sources for which you can create an account with.

You can select the appropriate category from the catalog on the left-hand side of your screen. Alternatively, you can find the specific source you wish to work with using the search option.

Under the **[!UICONTROL Advertising]** category, select **[!UICONTROL Google AdWords]**. If this is your first time using this connector, select **[!UICONTROL Configure]**. Otherwise, select **[!UICONTROL Add data]** to create a new [!DNL Google AdWords] connector.
