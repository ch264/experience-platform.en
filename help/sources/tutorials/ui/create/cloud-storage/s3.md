# Create a [!DNL Amazon] S3 source connector in the UI

Source connectors in Adobe Experience Platform provide the ability to ingest externally sourced data on a scheduled basis. This tutorial provides steps for creating an [!DNL Amazon] S3 (hereinafter referred to as "S3") source connector using the [!DNL Platform] user interface.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

-   [[!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) System](../../../../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which Experience Platform organizes customer experience data.
    -   [Basics of schema composition](../../../../../xdm/schema/composition.md): Learn about the basic building blocks of XDM schemas, including key principles and best practices in schema composition.
    -   [Schema Editor tutorial](../../../../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md): Learn how to create custom schemas using the Schema Editor UI.
-   [[!DNL Real-time Customer Profile]](../../../../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.

If you already have a valid S3 connection, you may skip the remainder of this document and proceed to the tutorial on [configuring a dataflow](../../dataflow/batch/cloud-storage.md).

### Supported file formats

[!DNL Experience Platform] supports the following file formats to be ingested from external storages:

-   Delimiter-separated values (DSV): Support for DSV formatted data files is currently limited to comma-separated values. The value of field headers within DSV formatted files must only consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores. Support for general DSV files will be provided in the future.
-   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON): JSON formatted data files must be XDM compliant.
-   Apache Parquet: Parquet formatted data files must be XDM compliant.

### Gather required credentials

In order to access your S3 bucket on [!DNL Platform], you need to provide valid values for the following credentials:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `s3AccessKey` | The access key ID for your S3 storage. |
| `s3SecretKey` | The secret key ID for your S3 storage. |

For more information on getting started, visit [this AWS document](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/wheres-my-secret-access-key/).

## Connect your S3 account

Once you have gathered your required credentials, you can follow the steps below to link your S3 account to [!DNL Platform].

Log in to [Adobe Experience Platform](https://platform.adobe.com) and then select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** from the left navigation bar to access the **[!UICONTROL Sources]** workspace. The **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** screen displays a variety of sources for which you can create an account with.

You can select the appropriate category from the catalog on the left-hand side of your screen. Alternatively, you can find the specific source you wish to work with using the search option.

Under the **[!UICONTROL Databases]** category, select **[!UICONTROL Amazon S3]**. If this is your first time using this connector, select **[!UICONTROL Configure]**. Otherwise, select **[!UICONTROL Add data]** to create a new S3 connector.

![catalog](../../../../images/tutorials/create/s3/catalog.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Connect to Amazon S3]** page appears. On this page, you can either use new credentials or existing credentials.

### New account

If you are using new credentials, select **[!UICONTROL New account]**. On the input form that appears, provide a name, an optional description, and your S3 credentials. When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Connect]** and then allow some time for the new connection to establish.

### Existing account

To connect an existing account, select the S3 account you want to connect with, then select **[!UICONTROL Next]** to proceed.

## Next steps and additional resources

By following this tutorial, you have established a connection to your S3 account. You can now continue on to the next tutorial and [configure a dataflow to bring data from your cloud storage into [!DNL Platform]](../../dataflow/batch/cloud-storage.md).
