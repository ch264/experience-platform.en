# Create a [!DNL Couchbase] connector using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Couchbase] connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

[!DNL Flow Service] is used to collect and centralize customer data from various disparate sources to bring into Adobe Experience Platform. The service provides a user interface and RESTful API from which all supported sources are connectable.

This tutorial uses the Flow Service API to walk you through the steps to connect [!DNL Couchbase] to [!DNL Experience Platform].

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

*   [Sources](../../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
*   [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to [!DNL Couchbase] using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `connectionString` | The connection string used to connect to your [!DNL Couchbase] instance. The connection string pattern for [!DNL Couchbase] is `Server={SERVER}; Port={PORT};AuthMech=1;CredString=[{\"user\": \"{USER}\", \"pass\":\"{PASS}\"}];`. For more information on acquiring a connection string, refer to [this Couchbase document](https://docs.Couchbase.com/c-sdk/2.10/client-settings.html#configuring-overview). |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The identifier needed to create a connection. The fixed connection spec ID for [!DNL Couchbase] is `1fe283f6-9bec-11ea-bb37-0242ac130002`. |

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to [!DNL Platform] APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](../../../../../tutorials/authentication.md). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all [!DNL Experience Platform] API calls, as shown below:

*   Authorization: Bearer `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`
*   x-api-key: `{API_KEY}`
*   x-gw-ims-org-id: `{IMS_ORG}`

All resources in [!DNL Experience Platform], including those belonging to [!DNL Flow Service], are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to [!DNL Platform] APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

*   x-sandbox-name: `{SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

*   Content-Type: `application/json`

## Create a connection

A connection specifies a source and contains your credentials for that source. Only one connector is required per [!DNL Couchbase] account as it can be used to create multiple source connectors to bring in different data.

**API format**

```http
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a new [!DNL Couchbase] connection, configured by the properties provided in the payload:.

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Couchbase test connection",
        "description": "A test connection for a Couchbase source",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Connection String Based Authentication",
            "params": {
                    "connectionString": "Server={SERVER}; Port={PORT};AuthMech=1;CredString=[{\"user\": \"{USER}\", \"pass\":\"{PASS}\"}];"
                }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "1fe283f6-9bec-11ea-bb37-0242ac130002",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `auth.params.connectionString` | The connection string used to connect to a [!DNL Couchbase] account. The connection string pattern is: `Server={SERVER}; Port={PORT};AuthMech=1;CredString=[{\"user\": \"{USER}\", \"pass\":\"{PASS}\"}];`. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The [!DNL Couchbase] connection spec ID: `1fe283f6-9bec-11ea-bb37-0242ac130002`. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the details of the newly created connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your data in the next tutorial.

```json
{
    "id": "54997109-07b5-40b7-9971-0907b5a0b75a",
    "etag": "\"280168f5-0000-0200-0000-5ed72b230000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created a [!DNL Couchbase] connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API and have obtained the connection's unique ID value. You can use this ID in the next tutorial as you learn how to [explore databases using the Flow Service API](../../explore/database-nosql.md).
