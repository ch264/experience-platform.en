# Create a [!DNL MariaDB] connector using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL MariaDB] connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

[!DNL Flow Service] is used to collect and centralize customer data from various disparate sources within Adobe Experience Platform. The service provides a user interface and RESTful API from which all supported sources are connectable.

This tutorial uses the [!DNL Flow Service] API to walk you through the steps to connect [!DNL Experience Platform] to [!DNL MariaDB].

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

*   [Sources](../../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
*   [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to [!DNL MariaDB] using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect with [!DNL MariaDB], you must provide the following connection property:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `connectionString` | The connection string associated with your [!DNL MariaDB] authentication. The [!DNL MariaDB] connection string pattern is: `Server={HOST};Port={PORT};Database={DATABASE};UID={USERNAME};PWD={PASSWORD}`. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The ID used to generate a connection. The fixed connection spec ID for [!DNL MariaDB] is `3000eb99-cd47-43f3-827c-43caf170f015`. |

For more information about obtaining a connection string, refer to [this MariaDB document](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/about-mariadb-connector-odbc/).

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to [!DNL Platform] APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](../../../../../tutorials/authentication.md). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all [!DNL Experience Platform] API calls, as shown below:

*   Authorization: Bearer `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`
*   x-api-key: `{API_KEY}`
*   x-gw-ims-org-id: `{IMS_ORG}`

All resources in [!DNL Experience Platform], including those belonging to the [!DNL Flow Service], are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to [!DNL Platform] APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

*   x-sandbox-name: `{SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

*   Content-Type: `application/json`

## Create a connection

A connection specifies a source and contains your credentials for that source. Only one connection is required per [!DNL MariaDB] account as it can be used to create multiple source connectors to bring in different data.

**API format**

```http
POST /connections
```

**Request**

In order to create a [!DNL MariaDB] connection, its unique connection spec ID must be provided as part of the POST request. The connection spec ID for [!DNL MariaDB] is `3000eb99-cd47-43f3-827c-43caf170f015`.

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Test connection for maria-db",
        "description": "Test connection for maria-db",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Connection String Based Authentication",
            "params": {
                "connectionString": "Server={HOST};Port={PORT};Database={DATABASE};UID={USERNAME};PWD={PASSWORD}"
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "3000eb99-cd47-43f3-827c-43caf170f015",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `auth.params.connectionString` | The connection string associated with your [!DNL MariaDB] authentication. The [!DNL MariaDB] connection string pattern is: `Server={HOST};Port={PORT};Database={DATABASE};UID={USERNAME};PWD={PASSWORD}`. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The [!DNL MariaDB] connection spec ID is: `3000eb99-cd47-43f3-827c-43caf170f015`. |

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created base connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your database in the next step.

```json
{
    "id": "be3a2d71-1fb6-4fea-ba2d-711fb61fea50",
    "etag": "\"02002624-0000-0200-0000-5e41f7040000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created a [!DNL MariaDB] connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API, and have obtained the connection's unique ID value. You can use this connection ID in the next tutorial as you learn how to [explore databases or NoSQL systems using the Flow Service API](../../explore/database-nosql.md).
