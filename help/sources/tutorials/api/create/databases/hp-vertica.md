# Create an HP [!DNL Vertica] connector using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

>[!NOTE]
>
>The HP [!DNL Vertica] connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

[!DNL Flow Service] is used to collect and centralize customer data from various disparate sources within Adobe Experience Platform. The service provides a user interface and RESTful API from which all supported sources are connectable.

This tutorial uses the [!DNL Flow Service] API to walk you through the steps to connect HP [!DNL Vertica] to [!DNL Experience Platform].

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Sources](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-platform/source-connectors/home.html): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, map, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
- [Sandboxes](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-platform/sandbox/home.html): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to HP [!DNL Vertica] using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect with HP [!DNL Vertica], you must provide values for the following connection properties:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `connectionString` | The connection string used to connect to your HP [!DNL Vertica] instance. The connection string pattern for HP [!DNL Vertica] is `Server={SERVER};Port={PORT};Database={DATABASE};UID={USERNAME};PWD={PASSWORD}` |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The identifier needed to create a connection. The fixed connection spec ID for HP [!DNL Vertica] is: `a8b6a1a4-5735-42b4-952c-85dce0ac38b5` |

For more information on acquiring a connection string, refer to [this HP Vertica document](https://www.vertica.com/docs/9.2.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/ConnectingToVertica/ClientJDBC/CreatingAndConfiguringAConnection.htm).

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html#reading-example-api-calls) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to [!DNL Platform] APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-platform/tutorials/authentication.html). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all [!DNL Experience Platform] API calls, as shown below:

- Authorization: Bearer `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`
- x-api-key: `{API_KEY}`
- x-gw-ims-org-id: `{IMS_ORG}`

All resources in [!DNL Experience Platform], including source connectors, are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to [!DNL Platform] APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

- x-sandbox-name: `{SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

- Content-Type: `application/json`

## Create a connection

A connection specifies a source and contains your credentials for that source. Only one connection is required per HP [!DNL Vertica] account as it can be used to create multiple source connectors to bring in different data.

**API format**

```http
POST /connections
```

**Request**

In order to create an HP [!DNL Vertica] connection, its unique connection spec ID must be provided as part of the POST request. The connection spec ID for HP [!DNL Vertica] is `a8b6a1a4-5735-42b4-952c-85dce0ac38b5`.

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Connection for HP Vertica",
        "description": "Connection for HP Vertica",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Connection String Based Authentication",
            "params": {
                "connectionString": "Server={SERVER};Port={PORT};Database={DATABASE};UID={USERNAME};PWD={PASSWORD}"
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "a8b6a1a4-5735-42b4-952c-85dce0ac38b5",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `auth.params.connectionString` | The connection string associated with your HP [!DNL Vertica] account. The connection string pattern for HP [!DNL Vertica] is: `Server={SERVER};Port={PORT};Database={DATABASE};UID={USERNAME};PWD={PASSWORD}`. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The HP [!DNL Vertica] connection spec ID: `a8b6a1a4-5735-42b4-952c-85dce0ac38b5`. |

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your data in the next tutorial.

```json
{
    "id": "6bc13a3b-3546-455f-813a-3b3546a55fb1",
    "etag": "\"3500866c-0000-0200-0000-5e83afa30000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created an HP [!DNL Vertica] connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API and have obtained the connection's unique ID value. You can use this ID in the next tutorial as you learn how to [explore databases using the Flow Service API](../../explore/database-nosql.md).
