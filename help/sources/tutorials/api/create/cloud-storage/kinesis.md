# Create an [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] connector using the Flow Service API

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Amazon Kineses] connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

[!DNL Flow Service] is used to collect and centralize customer data from various disparate sources within Adobe Experience Platform. The service provides a user interface and RESTful API from which all supported sources are connectable.

This tutorial uses the [!DNL Flow Service] API to walk you through the steps to connect [!DNL Experience Platform] to an [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] account.

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

*   [Sources](../../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
*   [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to an [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] account using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect with your [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] account, you must provide values for the following connection properties:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `accessKeyId` | The access key ID for your [!DNL Kinesis] account. |
| `secretKey` | The secret access key for your [!DNL Kinesis] account. |
| `region` | | The region for your [!DNL Kinesis] account. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The [!DNL Kinesis] connection specification ID: `86043421-563b-46ec-8e6c-e23184711bf6` |

For more information about these values, refer to [this Kinesis document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/getting-started.html).

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to [!DNL Platform] APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](../../../../../tutorials/authentication.md). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all [!DNL Experience Platform] API calls, as shown below:

*   Authorization: Bearer `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`
*   x-api-key: `{API_KEY}`
*   x-gw-ims-org-id: `{IMS_ORG}`

All resources in [!DNL Experience Platform], including those belonging to the [!DNL Flow Service], are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to [!DNL Platform] APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

*   x-sandbox-name: `{SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

*   Content-Type: `application/json`

## Create a connection

A connection specifies a source and contains your credentials for that source. Only one connection is required per [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] account as it can be used to create multiple source connectors to bring in different data.

**API format**

```http
POST /connections
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Amazon Kinesis connection",
        "description": "Connector for Amazon Kinesis",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Basic Authentication for Kinesis",
            "params": {
                "accessKeyId": "accessKeyId",
                "secretKey": "secretKey"
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "86043421-563b-46ec-8e6c-e23184711bf6",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `auth.params.accessKeyId` | The access key ID for your [!DNL Kinesis] account. |
| `auth.params.secretKey` | The secret access key for your [!DNL Kinesis] account. |
| `auth.params.region` | The region for your [!DNL Kinesis] account. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The [!DNL Kinesis] connection specification ID: `86043421-563b-46ec-8e6c-e23184711bf6` |

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your cloud storage data in the next tutorial.

```json
{
    "id": "4cb0c374-d3bb-4557-b139-5712880adc55",
    "etag": "\"6507cfd8-0000-0200-0000-5e18fc600000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created an [!DNL Amazon Kinesis] connection using APIs and a unique ID was obtained as part of the response body. You can use this connection ID to [explore cloud storages using the Flow Service API](../../explore/cloud-storage.md).
