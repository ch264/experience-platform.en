# (Beta) [!DNL Apache Spark] on [!DNL Azure HDInsights] connector

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Apache Spark] on [!DNL Azure HDInsights] connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

[!DNL Experience Platform] provides support for ingesting data from a third-party database. [!DNL Platform] can connect to different types of databases such as relational, NoSQL, or data warehouses. Support for database providers include [!DNL Apache Spark] on [!DNL Azure HDInsights].
