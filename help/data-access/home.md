## [!DNL Data Access] API

Detailed information on using the [!DNL Data Access] API to connect with [!DNL Platform] can be found in the [Data Access developer guide](api.md).

## [!DNL Python] SDK

You can read and write with datasets using the [!DNL Python] SDK. More detailed information about the [!DNL Python] SDK can be found in the [Python SDK tutorial](./tutorials/python-sdk.md). 

[!DNL Data Science Workspace] uses the [!DNL Python] SDK within Notebooks and Recipes. For more information about [!DNL Data Science Workspace], please start by reading the [Data Science Workspace overview](../data-science-workspace/home.md).

## [!DNL Spark] SDK

You can read and write with datasets using the [!DNL Spark] SDK. More detailed information about the [!DNL Spark] SDK can be found in the [Spark SDK tutorial](./tutorials/spark-sdk.md).

[!DNL Data Science Workspace] uses the [!DNL Spark] SDK within Notebooks and Recipes. For more information about [!DNL Data Science Workspace], please start by reading the [Data Science Workspace overview](../data-science-workspace/home.md).

## Subscribe to data ingestion events

[!DNL Platform] makes specific high-value events available for subscription through the [Adobe Developer Console](https://www.adobe.com/go/devs_console_ui). For instance, you can subscribe to data ingestion events to be notified of potential delays and failures. See the tutorial on [subscribing to data ingestion notifications](../ingestion/quality/subscribe-events.md) for more information.
